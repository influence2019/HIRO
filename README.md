# HIRO
All experiments are easly run by going to the robust.py file and commenting out the appropriate experiment. 

Real data experiment is currently running, once done we will upload the results. The experiment tests the speed of convergence of HIRO for a real data set with some 25k edges and real probabilities with carefully constructed confidence intervals. The experiment is currently running on a personal laptop so it might take a couple of days.
