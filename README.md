All experiments are easly run by going to the robust.py file and commenting out the appropriate experiment. 

Note the file MWU-convergence-real.pdf. This file contains the robust solution for a seed set of size 10 for the graph in https://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-sign-bitcoin-alpha.html?fbclid=IwAR24Uu77MDbcSAHRjrO3wXZD_gV7_821-z_eXR51FeAB6ri1C6-HnT4p_5c. The thetas were crafted in multiple ways and the experiment was ran in all shapes and kinds and the results seem the same - MWU converges extremely fast. We intend to continue investigating this phenomenon and would love any feedback in that regard.

Thanks for the interset in our work!
